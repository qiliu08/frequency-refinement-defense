# Frequency Refinement 

This repository contains the implementation of adversarial defense for deep learning biomedical segmentation models. This defense is proposed in a paper titled "Defending Deep Learning-based Biomedical Image Segmentation from Adversarial Attacks: A Low-cost Frequency Refinement Approach, " published in MICCAI-2020.
